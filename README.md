This fork builds on ALTO display work found in https://github.com/blekinge/altoviewer towards a working ALTO viewer for Islandora.
As it is now, this project is a scratchpad, a proof of concept, a feasibility test prototype; as such, it is likely not usable as is.


Sample content is included in `content/` 

This is the roughest of the rough proofs of concept, so don't stray far from http://localhost:8008/?vScale=0.5&hScale=0.5&image=19231115&format=highlight&article=1
